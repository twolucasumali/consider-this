## Overview

The world around us is rich with various opinions and biases. In this digital age, we engage with diverse content curated by algorithms that mirror our preferences and maximize our engagement on various platforms. This often results in an "echo-chamber," reinforcing our biases and social-political niches. Such echo chambers can hinder our ability to engage in productive discussions and make informed decisions, posing a significant challenge, especially for the younger generation growing up in the digital age.

**Consider This** is an innovative educational tool designed to foster healthy, empathetic discussions with AI agents, powered by Hume's cutting-edge EVI technology. Our platform helps users think critically, break free from echo chambers, and engage more thoughtfully.

## Problem Statement

The younger generation is particularly affected by digital echo chambers, which can limit their exposure to diverse perspectives and hinder their ability to think critically. How can we encourage our youth to think critically, break free from echo chambers, and engage more thoughtfully?

## Solution

Imagine you are a shy eighth-grader named Zelda. Your teacher introduces an assignment involving a dialogue with two influential figures holding divergent views on AI. You log onto the platform "Consider This" and engage in a discussion with Dr. Aisha Patel, a senior research scientist pioneering drug discovery using AI, and Valentino Rossi, an art gallery and studio owner cautious about art plagiarism in AI. This experience broadens your understanding of AI, boosts your confidence, and teaches you critical thinking, empathy, and the complex interplay of technology and society.
